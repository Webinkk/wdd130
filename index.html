        <p>Hello! I have a very energetic two year old daughter who so generously let me borrow her sunglasses for this picture. I love to read fantasy novels and I enjoy hosting a weekly session of Dungeons and Dragons for my wife and friends. I have lived in Arizona my whole life excluding the time that I spent serving my mission in Vanccouver Washington just north of Portland although I still live in Arizona I would love to be in the freezing rain anyday compared to this heat. I have recently been called to be a teachers quorum advisor which can be nerve racking! I also work a full-time job at a online high school that services the enire state. I chose this program because I have always enjoyed learning about computers and how they work and so I have always saught out learning more any chance I get. I feel like I have a bunch of ideas of things to create and present I just need the tools on how to do so. My ultimate goal is to create something that is either useful to myself and others or something fun for my family to enjoy.</p>

        <p>Arizona is the sunniest state in the United States of America. It's sunny days and high tempetures can be repulsive but the beauty of natural land formations and scenic mountain trails attract many across the world.</p>
